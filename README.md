# UDP-communication
This application is a simple demonstration of UDP communication

UDP is an unreliable protocol that is connectionless and cannot handle packet loss. 
This application improves UDP by adding in features to check connection establishment, as well as to
provide acknowledgement and retransmission mechanisms to ensure all lost packets will be re-delivered
